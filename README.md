# LaserBatcher
An open-source, online tool for batching multiple parts for laser operations. All files are processed locally, so no need to worry about your designs being stored up in the :cloud: someplace :smiley:.

This program is optimized to work with Glowforge lasers and designs made with Inkscape with the following considerations:

 - The document dimensions **must** be in **inches**

 - The document **should** be resized to fit the bounds of the SVG

 - Images **should** be converted to paths to improve performance. **Hint**: Use Path -> Trace Bitmap to convert an image into a path using Inkscape
